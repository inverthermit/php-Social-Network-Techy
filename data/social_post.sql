As of the 10.1 update, you can use the pressure-sensitive pad on newer MacBooks and MacBook Pros to vary the strength of certain tools -- if you want to subtly finesse a track using only your finger, you can. This is also a big upgrade if you\'re an aspiring DJ, since there\'s both a virtual morph pad as well as gobs of new dance- and hip-hop-friendly audio kits. You can check out all of GarageBand\'s new tricks for free if you already have GarageBand (not hard if you bought a relatively modern Mac), and it\'ll cost $5 if you\'re completely new.','27.bmp','2015-07-01 11:52:28'),(32,'tim','A closer look at Apple Music: feature-packed, but a bit disjointed<br>blogger-avatarby Chris Velazco | @chrisvelazco | 8 hrs ago<br><br>Apple Music is here. Finally. Now that the company steered the streaming service to a successful launch, it now has to prove to the world that it\'s actually something worth paying for — after all, there are like 80 other streaming-music services (maybe not, but it feels like it) fighting for the subscription revenue in our wallets. Apple\'s master plan: Make Apple Music a one-stop shop by kitting out it with gobs of features. We\'ll follow up with a longer write-up once we\'ve had more than a few hours to play with it, but for now, let\'s take a quick peek at what Apple came up with.','32.bmp','2015-07-01 11:55:49'),(35,'tim','Yelp study claims that Google \'knowingly\' worsens search results<br>blogger-avatarby Jon Fingas | @jonfingas | June 29th 2015 at 8:38 pm<br> 61<br>You can\'t search Google without magnifying glasses, right?<br>Yelp really, really isn\'t a fan of Google\'s search rankings, and it\'s making sure that you know it. The location-based service has partnered with net neutrality pioneer Tim Wu on a study alleging that Google is \"knowingly degrading\" search results by peppering the findings with hits from its own services, such as Google+ reviews. The research project notes that test subjects were 45 percent more likely to click search results when they were purely \"organic\" (that is, more objective) versus the usual Google-influenced material. This is reportedly proof that Google is compromising the quality of your searches for the sake of helping its own business, and Yelp goes on to liken the Mountain View team to the monopolies of AT&T and Microsoft.','35.bmp','2015-07-01 11:58:32'),(36,'tim','Windows 10 preview build comes with Microsoft Edge and WiFi<br>blogger-avatarby Mariella Moon | @mariella_moon | 21 hrs ago<br> 0<br><br>Microsoft\'s giving you the chance to try out its Edge browser before Windows 10 drops on July 29th, along with other new features that will come with the platform.

The European Commission had been pushing for an earlier implementation, but ultimately relented in order to win support from the European Parliament and Council. Under the new rules, Europeans will pay the same prices as they do at home, regardless of where they travel in the EU. However, such a move could be open to abuse -- after all, anyone could buy a cheaper SIM from a neighboring country and use it at home -- so there will be a fair use limit when roaming, after which networks can charge you a basic fee. While we wait for 2017 to roll around, Europe is prepping a stop-gap measure for next year. From April 2016, operators will be limited to the following maximum roaming charges: €0.20 per MB, €0.06 per SMS and €0.05 per minute -- the same rates that former EU Commission VP Neelie Kroes wanted to enforce last year.<br><br>Europe has also agreed upon new, stricter net neutrality rules. From April 30th, 2016, internet providers will be banned from blocking and throttling online content and services. In addition, paid prioritisation or \"fast lanes\" will be outlawed. However, there is one huge exception to this rule: the EU will allow providers to set aside parts of their network for \"specialised services of higher quality,\" such as IPTV. It\'s only under the condition that they don\'t affect people\'s access to the rest of the \"open internet,\" however. The EU says the concept is different to fast lanes, but any two-tier system is cause for concern.<br><br>Now, we just have to wait for the dates to roll around. The European Commission\'s next step is to finalise the new laws in writing and get them signed off by the European Parliament and Council. They\'ll then be translated into all EU languages, setting in motion the long-awaited move towards a fabled \"digital single market\" across Europe.<br><br>[Image Credit: AP Photo/Virginia Mayo]','37.bmp','2015-07-01 11:59:51'),(38,'hehe','Intel Compute Stick review: nothing more than a prototype for now<br>blogger-avatarby Devindra Hardawar | @devindra | May 30th 2015 at 2:00 pm<br> 0<br><br>Intel Compute Stick review: nothing more than a prototype for now<br><br>Intel\'s new Compute Stick isn\'t that hard to grasp: It\'s a computer... on a stick! Using one of its Atom processors, Intel managed to cram everything a fully functional PC needs in something the size of a few packs of gum for just $150. All you need to get going is to plug it into a display with an HDMI port, connect it to power and attach your accessories. It heralds a new era of computing, one where you can turn any display into a pseudo-desktop in a few minutes. It could change the way IT workers manage computer labs, kiosks and digital signage forever. And it\'s something you should avoid buying at all costs. While the Compute Stick gives us a glimpse at a tantalizing future, it\'s basically a beta product. It\'s only meant for the brave and geeky -- not most consumers.','38.bmp','2015-07-01 12:01:37'),(39,'hehe','DJI Phantom 3 review: an aerial photography drone for the masses<br>blogger-avatarby James Trew | @itstrew | June 26th 2015 at 11:00 am<br> 0<br><br><br>Almost a year ago to the day, I wrote about the impact DJI\'s Phantom 2 Vision+ might have on our skies. Up to that point, drones (or quadcoptors/multirotors, for the purists) had been slowly edging their way into mainstream consciousness. DJI\'s ready-to-fly Vision series, with their built-in cameras and easy operation turbocharged that creep into a march. The Phantom 3 Professional is what would have been the new Vision (it\'s dropped that branding), and is the first in this consumer lineage to shoot 4K video.<br><br>What\'s changed in the last 12 months? In some regards, not much. Governments are still figuring out how to legislate quadcopters, while people keep buying them. As for DJI, it\'s got a lot more competition, and higher expectations for what a drone should do. I was eager to spend time with the Phantom 3, and get a feel for how the company has evolved, and more importantly, where it\'s going — and it looks like taking over our skies is only one part of its plan.','39.bmp','2015-07-01 12:02:18'),(40,'hehe','Pebble Time review: an underdog among smartwatches<br>blogger-avatarby Nicole Lee | @nicole | May 27th 2015 at 1:00 pm<br> 0<br>OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA         <br><br>For two years, Pebble was the smartwatch company to beat. In 2012, it raised over $10 million on Kickstarter for its simple, monochrome e-paper wristwatch, putting itself and the crowdfunding site on the map. But things move quickly in the technology world. Google has since come out with Android Wear, prompting a slew of smartphone companies to suddenly turn into watchmakers. Not to be outdone, Apple joined the fray as well, positing its own wearable as a timepiece premium enough for high-end boutiques. So when Pebble debuted the Time, its second-generation $199 smartwatch, on Kickstarter three months ago, it was facing much stiffer competition. Surprisingly, that too made crowdfunding history, raising more than $20 million in just over a month. Did 78,471 backers make the right decision? I attempt to find out.','40.bmp','2015-07-01 12:03:36'),(41,'loli','AMC\'s \'Humans\' is an android story that\'s really about us<br> by Devindra Hardawar | @devindra | 12 hours ago<br><br>AMC, Humans<br><br>Early on in AMC\'s newest sci-fi show, Humans, a teenager wonders aloud if there\'s any point in going to college and spending years training to be a neurosurgeon. After all, why invest all that time and work when an advanced android, which are commonplace in the show\'s world, can be programmed with those skills almost instantly. Call it the death of human expertise. Meanwhile, her mother is worried that her family\'s new \"synth\" (the show\'s term for androids) might replace her; her father hopes it can bring her family back together; and her teenaged brother is having sexually confused feelings about their attractive new robot helper. In Humans, the problems of the near future are practically indistinguishable from the issues we\'re facing today. And that\'s a big part of why the show works so well.','41.bmp','2015-07-01 12:05:22'),(42,'John','LG Watch Urbane review: a premium watch that falls short of greatness<br>blogger-avatarby Chris Velazco | @chrisvelazco | May 15th 2015 at 11:00 am<br> 0<br>LG Watch Urbane review: a premium watch that falls short of greatness<br>There are only a few companies out there with as much experience making Android Wear watches as LG. After all, the platform\'s only been part of the public consciousness for a year and yet this Korean giant has already made three of them. Its first sequel -- the G Watch R -- was a marked improvement over its dull, plastic predecessor, but the progress isn\'t quite as clear with the new Watch Urbane. Sure, it\'s running a fresh version of the Wear operating system, with some neat new features that haven\'t yet trickled down to the rest of Google\'s wearable ecosystem. Hell, it\'s even got a look that\'s meant to rival the Patek Philippes in your collection. All that said, after over a week of testing, I still couldn\'t help but want more out of the Urbane, and you probably will too.','42.bmp','2015-07-01 12:15:26'),(43,'Tom','This is schedule of Mine','43.bmp','2015-07-01 14:36:12'),(48,'ruanjiannanshen','欢迎欢迎！热烈欢迎！','','2015-07-01 19:16:32'),(50,'tim','Garmin\'s Varia radar warns cyclists about traffic they can\'t see<br> by Aaron Souppouris | @aaronissocial | 45 mins ago<br><br>Garmin Varia<br><br>Six months. That\'s apparently how long it takes to buy a company, retool their product, and sell it under a new name. Garmin\'s new Varia Rearview Bike Radar is a rear light that scans up to 140m behind a bicycle for traffic. It then hands that data on to either a compatible Garmin Edge system or a standalone handlebar-mounted unit with an array of lights to warn riders of what\'s behind them and how fast it\'s approaching. If you\'re a keen cyclist, this idea may sound a little familiar. Startup iKubu made a little splash last year with Backtracker, which was essentially the same thing but a little rougher around the edges. Garmin bought the company back in January, and apparently wasted no time turning the Backtracker into what you see above.','50.bmp','2015-07-01 21:03:08'),(51,'tim','Sony has a new crowdfunding website for employee projects<br> by Mariella Moon | @mariella_moon | 1 hour ago<br><br><br>Last year, Sony revealed a business program that encouraged employees to develop the most innovative ideas they can think of in an effort to find new hits.

The trick is called homomorphic encryption, which MIT\'s Guy Zyskind compares to a black box: \"You send whatever data you want, and it runs in the black box and only returns the result.
